      linear: The transition progresses at a constant speed.
      ease: The transition starts slowly, accelerates, and then slows down at the end.
      ease-in: The transition starts slowly and accelerates.
      ease-out: The transition starts quickly and decelerates.
      ease-in-out: The transition starts slowly, accelerates, and then decelerates.
