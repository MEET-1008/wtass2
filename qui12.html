    
    Define the Keyframes
    Keyframes are the intermediate steps of the animation. They define the styles that an element should have at specific points during the animation. Keyframes are created using the @keyframes rule, followed by a name that you choose for your animation. Inside the @keyframes rule, you define the percentage of the animation's duration and the styles that the element should have at each percentage point.
    
    Once you've defined the keyframes, you need to apply the animation to the desired element using the animation property.
